### Overall Assessment

**1. Working Environment** Throughout my internship, I clearly felt a friendly, open, and positive working environment. The FCJ team members were always ready to support me when I encountered difficulties, even outside of working hours. The workspace was neat and comfortable, helping me to focus better each day. If there were improvements, I hope the company could organize more team-bonding activities to further strengthen everyone's bonds.

**2. Support from Mentors/Team Admins** Regarding mentors and team admins, I am truly grateful for their dedication and enthusiasm. The mentors provided clear guidance, patiently explained things when I was confused, and always encouraged me to proactively ask questions. What I appreciate most is that my mentor didn't "do it for me," but instead gave me the opportunity to think for myself and solve problems. The admin team also provided excellent support with materials, procedures, and created a favorable environment for me to focus on my studies and work.

**3. Job and Major Match**
The assigned work greatly supported my major, helping me reinforce my foundational knowledge from school while also opening up many new areas of knowledge that I hadn't encountered before. As a result, I not only improved my theoretical knowledge but also gained a clearer understanding of how that knowledge is applied in practice.

**4. Opportunities for Learning & Skill Development**
During the internship, I had the opportunity to learn and develop many important skills such as teamwork, using project management tools, and communication in a professional work environment. In addition, the practical insights from my mentor gave me a clearer vision of my future career path.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**
The culture and team spirit are a major highlight. Everyone respects each other, works seriously but without stress or pressure. When there's urgent work, everyone is ready to support each other regardless of position. Thanks to this, even as an intern, I always feel like I'm part of a team.

**6. Policies/Benefits for Interns**
Regarding policies for interns, the company provides allowances and flexible working hours when needed. In particular, participating in internal training sessions helped me learn a lot of knowledge and practical experience.
